# MacBook Landing Page Replica

A project that replicates Apple's MacBook landing page built with modern tools like React, Three.js, GSAP, and TailwindCSS. This project demonstrates how to create stunning 3D product scenes, scroll animations, pinned sections, and responsive design with a sleek Apple-style aesthetic.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🎨 **3D Product Scenes**: Interactive 3D visuals of a MacBook created with [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
- 🖱️ **Scroll Animations**: Content animations triggered by scrolling, powered by [GSAP](https://greensock.com/).
- 📌 **Pinned Sections**: Smooth scrolling experience with fixed "pinned" sections for a dynamic layout.
- 🍏 **Apple-Style Design**: Inspired by the clean, minimalistic design philosophy of Apple.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React**: A powerful library for building modern user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for rendering 3D animations in the browser.
- **GSAP**: GreenSock Animation Platform for crafting scroll and trigger-based animations.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for elegant and responsive designs.
- **JavaScript**: Glues the project together with custom logic.

## 🌐 Key Features

### 1. **Three.js Integration**
This project leverages Three.js to create realistic 3D product models and scenes directly within the browser.

### 2. **Animation with GSAP**
Interactive scroll-based animations, including pinned sections and product reveals, are fully powered by GSAP.

### 3. **Responsive Design**
Using TailwindCSS, this site ensures accessibility and responsiveness across all screen sizes.
